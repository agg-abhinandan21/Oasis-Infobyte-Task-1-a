📊 Completed Level-1(a)

Task: EDA on Fast Food Menu Dataset

📌 Internship: Oasis Infobyte Virtual Internship

🛠 Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Google Colab

I explored a fast-food nutrition dataset (menu.csv) to uncover insights related to calories, fat, sodium, and sugar content across various food categories.

🔍 Project Highlights:

Cleaned and analyzed nutritional data for menu items

Visualized calorie distribution, fat content, and sugar levels using boxplots and histograms

Used correlation heatmaps to detect relationships between nutritional values

Created bar charts to compare average calories per food category

Generated pair plots for multivariate analysis

🔎 Key Insights:

Some menu categories had extremely high calorie and fat content

Found strong correlations between total fat and calories, and between sugars and carbohydrates

Identified categories with healthier choices based on nutrient values

👉 This project helped sharpen my skills in EDA, data cleaning, and storytelling through visualizations.
